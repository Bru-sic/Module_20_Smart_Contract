# Technologies
* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - A statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum
* [OpenZepplin Safe Math](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/math) - wrappers over Solidityâ€™s arithmetic operations with added overflow checks which trigger exceptions in the event of arithmetic overflow so as to catch bugs and minimise opportunities for exploits.
* [Remix - Ethereum IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for smart contract development that includes developer Graphical User Interface (GUI), Solidity compiler, 
* [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#the-ethereum-virtual-machine)

# Concepts
* Ethereum Blockchain Transactions

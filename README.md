## 3. Screenshots following `withdraw` execution
These also show the `contractBalance`, `lastToWithdraw` and `lastWithdrawAmount` functions were executed following the `withdraw` to verify that the funds were withdrawn from the contract as can be seen in the `RUN & DEPLOY TRANSACTIONS` panel on the left.

### 3.1 `withdraw` of 5 ether into `accountOne`

# Scope for Future Enhancements
The following changes / enhancements were considered but not implmented for reasons of needing to remain broadly within the confines of the original starter code and scoring guidelines. Potential future releases could include:
1. Using a Mapping, ideally an [Iterable Mapping](https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/blob/master/library/iterable_mapping.sol) to keep track of account owner addresses, thus allowing the contract to have a larger number of joint account holders without the need to hard code corresponding
individual variables. E.g. `mapping (address => bool) private _accountOwners`  instead of `accountThree`, `accountFour` etc.
2. Calling `setAccounts` from a newly defined `constructor` function to avoid any time lag between when the contract is created and when the 
accounts are set, to avoid potential for hijacking the contract during that interim state.

# Technologies
* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - A statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum
* [OpenZepplin Safe Math](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/math) - wrappers over Solidityâ€™s arithmetic operations with added overflow checks which trigger exceptions in the event of arithmetic overflow so as to catch bugs and minimise opportunities for exploits.
* [Remix - Ethereum IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for smart contract development that includes developer Graphical User Interface (GUI), Solidity compiler, 
* [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#the-ethereum-virtual-machine)

# Concepts
* Ethereum Blockchain Transactions
* Smart Contract
* Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)


# Enhancements to base starter code
* Items marked as @TODO
* Error Handling and Validation
  * Provisioned Safe Math to intercept arithmetic overflow exploits (although not used as no arithmetic functions were necessary).
* Documentation and Commenting
  * Adopted [Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format \(NatSpec\)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/natspec-format.html) for code commenting. 
  * Added in-depth comments in complex sections of the code to enhance the maintainability and scalability of the application code. 

# Dependencies
* OpenZepplin Safe Math

# Installation / Setup
No installation is required if using the web app online version of [Remix Online IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
